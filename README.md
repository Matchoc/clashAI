# Clash AI
This is intended as both a serious project in AI, Python, Image Manipulation and machine learning as well as a simple Clash Royale bot to gather trophies during clan chest weekends.

## WARNING
I cannot be held responsible if you get banned using this. It is against the rule. However, the AI is intended to play like a human and does not cheat in any way.

## Prerequisites
Checkout my other project [python_env](https://github.com/Matchoc/python_env).
python_env has notepad++ as the IDE and an installation of python 3.0 with all the required libraries.

You will also need an emulator for Clash Royale on PC. I use BlueStack in 1296x729 (recommended settings)
Any other emulator or resolution and you will need to redo the configurations in the file clashAI.py

The AI assume you have the following deck :
* Giant
* Balloon
* Archer
* Minion
* Minion Horde
* Squeleton Army
* Fireball
* Zap

## Installing
No installation required once you have bluestack, python_env and ClashAI checkout somewhere on your disk.

## Run
* Open clashAI.py with notepadd++ from python_env/npp.
* Start BlueStack
* Install/Run Clash Royale on BlueStack
* Make sure your game is on the "Start Battle" screen
* Hit F5 in notepad++
* Don't touch the mouse while the AI is playing
* To kill the AI, select the log window in Notepad++ and hit Ctrl-C

## Note

If some files are missing it is because they do not belong to me and I will not make them available, you will need to find them yourself.
