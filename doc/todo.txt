todo:

- Advanced :
   - Calculate arena time
   - Determine ennemy/allied position
   - Determine ennemy/allied types
   - Calculate unit health
   - Calculate tower health

Really Advanced :
   - Detect chest status (daily, crown, won chest). Start unlocks and click to download cards during the day !
   - Robot reward system training.

done :
   - determine card in hand (not sure it'll work when sidebar is there tough :/)
- Run basic sequence 
   - start battle
   - play some cards
   - check for game end
   - click "ok"
   - start next battle
- Fix detect of victory, color of button change ever so slightly by the arena. Use "close enough" ?
- delta time.seconds doesn't give me fraction... use millisecond ?
   - Calculate remaining mana
- windows size is variable depending on the sidebar being present or not (not perfect but works for now...)
   - need to calculate aspect ratio if I want to keep using absolute references to be fast
   - need to detect if sidebar is there or not !
- speed up card detection, takes 2 to 12 seconds right now T_T (reduced lookup area.... still a bit slow imho 0.3 to 1.5sec per card)
